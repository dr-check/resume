# Static Resume Website
This project can be used as a template for a basic resume website.
It is not fancy. I am not fancy. Enjoy!

This project was created as part of the web design basics course for WGU.

You may look at it for educational purposes but please do not copy any of the code.
I do not condone cheating.

## How to Use
Honestly this was all just practicing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and how to make websites
actually run on my local machine and through GitHub's website.
If you want a real website, use a real website generator.

Use SquareSpace. Make website good.
